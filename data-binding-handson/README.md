Project details:

As a part of this handson, I will be covering the following items to get familiar with Data binding concepts in Angular.

Add a Input field which updates a property ('username') via Two-Way-Binding <br />
Output the username property via String Interpolation (in a paragraph below the input) <br />
Add a button which may only be clicked if the username is NOT an empty string <br />
Upon clicking the button, the username should be reset to an empty string <br />
